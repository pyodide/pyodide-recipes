source:
  # the build script for pyarrow is stored in meta.yaml.backup file. You can use that to build pyarrow from source.
  # however, we are not building from source in CI to save time as it takes a long time to build.
  # TODO: upstream the build script to arrow so we don't need to maintain it here.
